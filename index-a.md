<h2>Argon-aframe</h2> This extension to the aframe-framework allows you to create 3D graphic experiences by making use of custom html tags. For many experiences you will need only html. You can add further features to your experience by writing additional javascript scripts.

[aframe] (https://aframe.io) describes itself as "an open-source WebVR framework for creating virtual reality (VR) experiences with HTML." It is a html-based adapation of the graphics frame threejs, which makes it very easy to produce 3D graphic objects and animations.
