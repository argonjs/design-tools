title: 'Part 1: Getting Started with Argon for Twine'
---

In order to make it easier to program narrative experiences, Argon has been integrated with the interactive narrative framework called `Twine`. You can learn about Twine from the [frameworks website](http://twinery.org)

As noted. Argon for Twine uses a special format called OldFashioned, which you have to add to your Twine app (or the browser if you are using Twine from the browser). OldFashion is based on the Twine format called SugarCube, but is adapted to support AR features provided by Argon.
